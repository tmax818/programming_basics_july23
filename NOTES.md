# order of operations

## [overview](https://login.codingdojo.com/m/667/15299/111622)

>If you remember your past math classes, you probably recall that the order in which certain math operations happen matters a lot for some problems, and in some cases the order doesn't matter for the eventual result.

```js
var PEMDAS = "Please excuse my dear aunt sally"
PEMDAS = "parenthesis, exponents, multiplication(left to right), division(left to right), addition(left to right), and subtraction(left to right)"
```
